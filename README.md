# TeamAvengersMERNStack

This is the repository for the BIT 4454 Seminar project.  In this project, we will be developing a web application to be used by the Singapore Management University (SMU).

This repository contains the code for both the front end and the back end of this web application.  For this project, a MERN stack was developed.  This incorporated
MySQL, Express, React.js, and Node.js.  Express and Node.js were used to create a server, router, and to write a Rest API to make calls to and from the database.
MySQL was where the database was housed and accessed.  React was used for the front end of the application.

For this project, we will be developing a web-based peer-evaluation system.  This will be a web application.  There are some basic functions/user stories that should be accomplished by this web application.  These include:
  - Allow the professor to import students and courses
  - Allow the professor to create student groups
  - Allow the professor to schedule peer evaluations
  - Alow the student to complete peer evaluations
  - Provide operational reporting, for all of the above
